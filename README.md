# About Final Term

Final Term is a new breed of terminal emulator.

It goes beyond mere emulation and understands what is happening inside the shell it is hosting. This allows it to offer features no other terminal can, including:

* Semantic text menus
* Smart command completion
* GUI terminal controls

# Installation

Final Term is written in [Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala) and built on top of [GTK+ 3](http://www.gtk.org), [Clutter](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/) and [Mx](https://github.com/clutter-project/mx). It requires the development files for the following software packages:

* [Gee](https://live.gnome.org/Libgee)
* [GTK+ 3](http://www.gtk.org)
* [Clutter](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/)
* [Clutter-Gtk](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/)
* [Mx](https://github.com/clutter-project/mx)
* [keybinder-3.0](https://github.com/engla/keybinder/tree/keybinder-3.0)

To install Final Term, execute these shell commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/p-e-w/finalterm.git
cd finalterm
make
```

Then, run Final Term using

```
./finalterm
```

## Instructions for Fedora

The following concrete steps have been tested and work to get Final Term installed and running on a vanilla Fedora 18 system:

### Install prerequisites

```
sudo yum install git vala libgee-devel gnome-common gtk-doc gtk3-devel libmx-devel clutter-gtk-devel
```

### Install keybinder-3.0

Note that the Fedora repositories only contain the package "keybinder", which is linked against GTK+ 2.

```
git clone https://github.com/engla/keybinder.git
cd keybinder/
git checkout keybinder-3.0
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
```

### Install Final Term

```
git clone https://github.com/p-e-w/finalterm.git
cd finalterm
make
```

### If keybinder cannot be found

Unfortunately, the keybinder install script fails to install the Vala bindings properly. To fix this, in the keybinder root directory, execute:

```
sudo cp examples/keybinder.vapi /usr/share/vala/vapi/
```

### If keybinder still cannot be found

On Fedora there are sometimes further problems locating the keybinder library. To work around those, in the keybinder root directory, execute:

```
sudo cp /usr/local/include/keybinder-3.0/keybinder.h /usr/include/
sudo cp /usr/local/lib/libkeybinder-3.0.* /usr/lib/
```

### Make termlets executable

In the Final Term root directory, execute:

```
chmod +x Termlets/*
```

### Run Final Term

In the Final Term root directory, execute:

```
./finalterm
```

# Acknowledgments

Final Term owes much of its existence to the awesomeness of [Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala) and [its documentation](http://valadoc.org), [Clutter](http://blogs.gnome.org/clutter/) and [Mx](https://github.com/clutter-project/mx), as well as to those projects authors' generous decision to release their amazing work as open source software.

Much of the knowledge about terminal emulation required to build Final Term was gained from [the xterm specification](http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html) and the [VT100 User Guide](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/contents.html), as well as from the study of existing terminal emulators such as [st](http://st.suckless.org) and [Terminator](http://software.jessies.org/terminator/).

Final Term's color schemes are generated using the wonderful [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) by Chris Kempson.

Final Term's application icon is a modified version of the terminal icon from the [Faenza icon theme](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228) by Matthieu James.
